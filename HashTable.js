// maps/ hash maps/ unordered maps/ dictionary/ object  end so on

// It is consist of key and value, so every single key could be mappinig with specific value.

// Also, there are some internal components. Hash codes, Hash function and Array. 

// Internally, Hash table has to be uesd Array. 

// Firstly, we can generate Hash code with key and Hash function, and the Hash code can be index of Array.
// which means the hash codes are integer, and they are designated fixed array space.

// Soâ€¦ 	it is possible to access directly with hashcode.
